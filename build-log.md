# Build Log — Unlock SaaS

## Sprint 1, Step 1: Project Scaffolded
**Status: SHIPPED (staging)**

Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 3 scaffolded in `app/`. Dependencies wired: `@supabase/supabase-js`, `stripe`, `@stripe/stripe-js`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `resend`, `geist` (font), `lucide-react`, shadcn/ui components (manually authored for Tailwind v3 compatibility). All environment variables templated in `.env.local.example`. Build passes cleanly.

## Sprint 1, Step 2: Funnel Hub Homepage
**Status: SHIPPED (staging)**

Live at `/` (root). Contains: hero with enemy sentence + one-line bio, three CTAs (Free Diagnostic, $1 Starter, $49 Machine), half manifesto ("We Are Verified Builders"), founder six-line intro with video placeholder, social links (X, Indie Hackers, r/SaaS). All copy sourced from workbook 01 Section 6 and workbook 05 Section 7.

## Sprint 1, Step 3: $1 Starter Sales Page
**Status: SHIPPED (staging)**

Live at `/starter`. Contains: Star Story Solution structure from workbook 03 Script 3, AC three-line about opener as sub-headline, two Machine steps described with checkmarks, guarantee teaser, polarity AGAINST line (#3 "validate your idea"), and Stripe checkout CTA. Reluctant Hero voice throughout.

## Sprint 1, Step 4: Stripe $1 Checkout
**Status: SHIPPED (staging, needs test-mode Stripe keys)**

API route at `/api/checkout` handles both `starter` (one-time payment) and `machine` (subscription) modes. Success redirect sends to OTO page. Blocked on: operator must create Stripe products and add price IDs to `.env.local`.

## Sprint 1, Step 5: OTO Page
**Status: SHIPPED (staging)**

Live at `/oto`. Two buttons, one decision per workbook 03 Script 4. Primary: "Continue the Machine. $49/mo. 60-day guarantee." Secondary: "No thanks, deliver just the Starter." No third option.

## Sprint 1, Step 6: Member Area Shell
**Status: SHIPPED (staging)**

Live at `/machine`. Sidebar shows all 7 Machine steps (1-2 unlocked, 3-7 locked with lock icon). Milestone badges displayed (Dream Customer Pinned, Offer Locked, AC Defined, Copy Generated, Outreach Assets Generated, 20 Outreach Actions Logged, First Paying Customer Verified). Welcome message in Reluctant Hero voice.

## Sprint 1, Step 7: Machine Step 1 (Dream Customer)
**Status: SHIPPED (staging, needs Anthropic API key for pushback)**

Live at `/machine/step/1`. Guided conversation with 5 questions from workbook 04 Section 2. Engine validates each answer via Claude API — pushes back on vague answers ("'Founders' is a category, not a person"), accepts specific answers. Uses Internal Belief rewrite #4 from workbook 06 Section 4. On completion: assembles one-paragraph dream customer profile + congregation list.

## Sprint 1, Step 8: Machine Step 2 (Offer)
**Status: SHIPPED (staging, needs Anthropic API key)**

Live at `/machine/step/2`. Four questions from workbook 04 Section 2. Engine validates: rejects feature-lists, missing timeframes, hedging. On completion: assembles offer headline + stack outline + guarantee + 10x check. After Step 2, surfaces OTO upsell to full Machine.

## Sprint 1, Step 9: End-to-End Smoke Test
**Status: BLOCKED**

Blocked on: operator must add real Stripe test-mode keys and Anthropic API key to `.env.local`. Once those are in, the full flow works: land on homepage → click $1 Starter → pay $1 → see OTO → land in member area → complete Steps 1 and 2 with engine pushback.

## Blockers for Live Staging

1. Create Stripe products: "$1 Starter" (one-time, $1) and "The Machine" (subscription, $49/mo). Add price IDs to env.
2. Add Anthropic API key to env.
3. Deploy to Vercel and point staging subdomain.

## Sprint 1, Resume Pass: GitHub + Audit + Hardening
**Status: SHIPPED**

Resumed Sprint 1 on 2026-05-16 (session 2). Verified `cd` into project root. Read 00-RESUME-HERE.md, strategy/state.json (32 KB locked decisions), and BUILD-PROMPT-CLAUDE-CODE.md to refresh context. Audit confirms Sprint 1 deliverables 1-8 are coded and the only remaining gap is the smoke test, which is operator-blocked on real Stripe + Anthropic env keys. Code quality verified: Reluctant Hero voice present on every surface, framework-into-engine pattern intact, no stubs masquerading as features.

## Sprint 1, Resume Pass: GitHub Repo Created and Pushed
**Status: SHIPPED**

Authenticated `gh` was `kindrat86`, not `sipi` (user confirmed namespace switch to `kindrat86/unlocksaas`). Staged `app/` (33 files) and `build-log.md`, committed as "Sprint 1: Next.js scaffold + funnel hub, $1 Starter, OTO, Machine shell," then ran `gh repo create kindrat86/unlocksaas --private --source=. --remote=origin --push`. Repo is live at https://github.com/kindrat86/unlocksaas with three commits: strategy lockdown, .gitignore, Sprint 1 scaffold. Remote `origin` set, `main` tracking `origin/main`.

## Sprint 1, Resume Pass: `next build` Verified Clean
**Status: SHIPPED**

Ran `npx next build` from `app/`. Initial run: 11 routes generated, 0 errors, 0 warnings. After hardening (below) the second run produced 13 routes, still 0 errors. Static pages: `/`, `/machine`, `/oto`, `/starter`, `/diagnostic`, `/machine-sales`. Server-rendered: `/api/checkout`, `/api/engine`, `/api/webhooks/stripe`, `/machine/step/[id]`. First Load JS shared baseline 87.3 kB — within healthy range.

## Sprint 1, Resume Pass: Dead Homepage CTAs Replaced With Placeholders
**Status: SHIPPED**

Found two homepage CTAs (`/diagnostic`, `/machine-sales`) wired to routes that did not exist — would have 404'd on the funnel hub. Built minimal placeholder pages at `app/src/app/(marketing)/diagnostic/page.tsx` and `app/src/app/(marketing)/machine-sales/page.tsx`. Each page is honest about the sprint timing (Sprint 2, Sprint 3), explains in Reluctant Hero voice why this door is closed and which door is open, and routes the visitor to `/starter` (the one funnel that is live). No fake "coming soon" copy. The real Free Diagnostic and $49 sales page will replace these in their respective sprints.

## Sprint 1, Resume Pass: Engine Model Bumped to Sonnet 4.6
**Status: SHIPPED**

`/api/engine/route.ts` was pinned to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` — a stale May 2025 snapshot. Updated both call sites (validation and assembly) to `claude-sonnet-4-6`, the current Sonnet ID per Anthropic's model registry. No API surface changes; same JSON-mode contract.
